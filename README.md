# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier (NumPy)

This project is a simple implementation of a neural network from scratch using **NumPy**, trained to recognize handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer).

---

## Features

- Two-layer neural network (ReLU + Softmax)
- Trained using gradient descent
- No external ML libraries — just **NumPy**
- Evaluates accuracy on a development set
- Easy to customize and extend
- Visualize predictions on sample images
- Save and load model weights
- Add loss plotting

---

## Dataset

Download the `train.csv` from the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data) and place it in the project root or update the path in the code.

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-numpy-classifier.git
   cd mnist-numpy-classifier
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   - Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Run all cells to train the model and evaluate accuracy.

## Model Architecture

- **Input Layer**: 784 nodes (28x28 pixels)
- **Hidden Layer**: 64 nodes with ReLU
- **Output Layer**: 10 nodes with Softmax (for digits 0–9)

## Sample Output

```
Iteration 0 - Training Accuracy: 0.11
Iteration 50 - Training Accuracy: 0.45
...
Dev Set Accuracy: 0.87
```

## Extra Features

### 👀 Visualize Predictions on Sample Images
```python
show_sample_predictions(X_dev, Y_dev, W1, b1, W2, b2)
```

### Save and Load Model Weights
```python
save_weights(W1, b1, W2, b2)
W1, b1, W2, b2 = load_weights()
```

### Plot Training Loss
```python
plt.plot(losses)
plt.title("Training Loss")
plt.xlabel("Iteration")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
